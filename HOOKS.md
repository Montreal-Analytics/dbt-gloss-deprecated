:exclamation:**If you have an idea for a new hook or you found a bug, [let us know](https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss/issues/new)**:exclamation:

## Available Hooks
### `check-column-desc-are-same`

Check the models have the same descriptions for the same column names.

#### Arguments

`--ignore`: columns for which do not check whether have a different description.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-column-desc-are-same
```

#### When to use it

E.g. in two of your models, you have `customer_id` with the description `This is cutomer_id`, but there is one model where column `customer_id` has a description `Something else`. This hook finds discrepancies between column descriptions.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :x: Not needed since it also validates properties files | :x: Not needed |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml` and `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- Modified `yml` files are scanned for a model.
- If any column in the found model has different descriptions than others, the hook fails.
- The description must be in either the yml file **or** the manifest.

-----
### `check-column-name-contract`

Check that column name abides to a contract, as described in [this blog post](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/column-name-contracts/) by Emily Riederer. A contract consists on a regex pattern and a data type.

#### Arguments

`--pattern`: Regex pattern to match column names.
`--dtype`: Data type.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-column-name-contract
   args: [--pattern, "(is|has|do)_.*", --dtype, boolean]
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure your columns follow a contract, e.g. all your boolean columns start with the prefixes `is_`, `has_` or `do_`.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :x: Not needed | :white_check_mark: Yes |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If any column in the found model matches the regex pattern and it's data type does not match the contract's data type, the hook fails.
- If any column in the found model matches the contract's data type and does not match the regex pattern, the hook fails.


-----
### `check-model-columns-have-desc`

Ensures that the model has columns with descriptions in the properties file (usually `schema.yml`).

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-columns-have-desc
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure that all specified columns in the properties files (usually `schema.yml`) have some description. **This hook does not validate if all database columns are also present in a properties file.**
#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :x: Not needed since it also validates properties files | :x: Not needed |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `yml` and `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- Modified `yml` files are scanned for a model.
- If any column in the found model does not contain a description, the hook fails.
- The description must be in either the yml file **or** the manifest.

#### Known limitations

If you `run` your model and then you delete column description from a properties file, the hook success since the description is still present in `manifest.json`.

-----
### `check-model-has-all-columns`

`--catalog`: location of `catalog.json` file. Usually `target/catalog.json`. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site. In dbt-gloss is used for column operations. **Default: `target/catalog.json`**

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-has-all-columns
```

#### When to use it

You want to make sure that you have all the database columns listed in the properties file, or that your properties file no longer contains deleted columns.
#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If there is any discrepancy between manifest and catalog models, the hook fails.

#### Known limitations

If you did not update the catalog and manifest results can be wrong.

### `check-model-parents-and-childs`

Ensures the model has a specific number (max/min) of parents or/and childs.

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**<br/>
`--min-parent-cnt`: Minimal number of parent sources and models.

 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: check-model-parents-and-childs
   args: ["--min-parent-cnt", "2", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You want to find orphaned models (empty file, hard-coded reference, etc.). Or you want to make sure that every model is used somewhere so you are not e.g. materializing unused tables.
#### Requirements

`--schema-file`: Location of schema.yml file. Where new source tables should be created.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: generate-missing-sources
   args: ["--schema-file", "models/schema.yml", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You are too lazy to define schemas manually :D.
#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :x: Not needed since this hook tries to generate even non-existent source | :x: Not needed |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- SQL is parsed to find all sources.
- If the source exists in the manifest, nothing is done.
- If not, a new source is created in specified `schema-file` and the hook fails.

#### Known limitations

Source "envelope" has to exist in specified `schema-file`, something like this:

```
version: 2
sources:
- name: <source_name>
```

Otherwise, it is not possible to automatically generate a new source table.

Unfortunately, this hook breaks your formatting.

### `unify-column-description`

Unify column descriptions across all models.

#### Arguments

`--ignore`: Columns for which do not check whether have a different description.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: unify-column-description
   args: ["--ignore", "foo", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You want the descriptions of the same columns to be the same. E.g. in two of your models, you have `customer_id` with the description `This is cutomer_id`, but there is one model where column `customer_id` has a description `Something else`. This hook finds discrepancies between column descriptions and replaces them. So as the results all columns going to have the description `This is customer_id`

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :x: Not needed since this hook is using only yaml files | :x: Not needed |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `YAML` files.
- From those files columns are parsed and compared.
- If one column name has more than one (not empty) description, the description with the most occurrences is taken and the hook fails.
- If it is not possible to decide which description is dominant, no changes are made.

#### Known limitations

If it is not possible to decide which description is dominant, no changes are made.

### `replace-script-table-names`

Replace table names with `source` or `ref` macros in the script.

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: replace-script-table-names
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You are running and debugging your `SQL` in the editor. This editor does not know `source` or `ref` macros. So every time you copy the script from the editor into `dbt` project you need to rewrite all table names to `source` or `ref`. That's boring and error-prone. If you run this hook it will replace all table names with macros instead of you.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :white_check_mark: Yes | :x: Not needed |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- SQL is parsed and table names are found.
- Firstly it tries to find table name in models - `ref`.
- Then it tries to find a table in sources - `source`.
- If nothing is found it creates unknown `source` as `source('<schema_name>', '<table_name>')`
- If the script contains only `ref` and `source` macros, the hook success.

### `generate-model-properties-file`

Generate model properties file if does not exist.

#### Arguments

`--manifest`: location of `manifest.json` file. Usually `target/manifest.json`. This file contains a full representation of dbt project. **Default: `target/manifest.json`**.<br/>
`--catalog`: location of `catalog.json` file. Usually `target/catalog.json`. dbt uses this file to render information like column types and table statistics into the docs site. In dbt-gloss is used for column operations. **Default: `target/catalog.json`**<br/>
`--properties-file`: Location of file where new model properties should be generated. Suffix has to be `yml` or `yaml`. It can also include {database}, {schema}, {name} and {alias} variables. E.g. /models/{schema}/{name}.yml for model `foo.bar` will create properties file in /models/foo/bar.yml. If path already exists, properties are appended.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: generate-model-properties-file
   args: ["--properties-file", "/models/{schema}/{name}.yml", "--"]
```

:warning: do not forget to include `--` as the last argument. Otherwise `pre-commit` would not be able to separate a list of files with args.

#### When to use it

You are running and debugging your `SQL` in the editor. This editor does not know `source` or `ref` macros. So every time you copy the script from the editor into `dbt` project you need to rewrite all table names to `source` or `ref`. That's boring and error-prone. If you run this hook it will replace all table names with macros instead of you.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :white_check_mark: Yes | :x: Yes |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- The model name is obtained from the `SQL` file name.
- The manifest is scanned for a model.
- The catalog is scanned for a model.
- If the model does not have `patch_path` in the manifest, the new schema is written to the specified path. The hook fails.

#### Known limitations

Unfortunately, this hook breaks your formatting in the written file.

-----

### `remove-script-semicolon`

Remove the semicolon at the end of the script.

#### Example
```
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/Montreal-Analytics/dbt-gloss
 rev: v1.0.0
 hooks:
 - id: remove-script-semicolon
```

#### When to use it

You are too lazy or forgetful to delete one character at the end of the script.

#### Requirements

| Model exists in `manifest.json` <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> | Model exists in `catalog.json` <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> |
| :----: | :----------: |
| :x: Not needed | :x: Not needed |

<sup id="f1">1</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt run`, `dbt compile` before run this hook.<br/>
<sup id="f2">2</sup> It means that you need to run `dbt docs generate` before run this hook.

#### How it works

- Hook takes all changed `SQL` files.
- If the file contains a semicolon at the end of the file, it is removed and the hook fails.
